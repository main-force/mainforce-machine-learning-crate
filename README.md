# mainforce-machine-learning-crate
# Background created

I wanted to use crates like sklearn and pandas at Rust.

But the crates didn't develop yet, or they looked unstable.

So I decided to make it meself using the std as much as possible.

There are many reasons why I make this.

- I want to feel similar to the customer experience offered by Sklearn, Pandas.
- I want to study machine learning using Rust.
- Using Sklearn, I couldn't know the meaning of functions such as predict(). So I want to make my own crate that I can understand.

# Target user

- Mainforce = Me.
- Anyone who wants to use my unstable crate firmly.

# Goals

Create machine learning crates for use by **'Me'**, not others.

# If you want to use firmly..
crate name: mf_machine_learning

I didn't upload this crate at crate.io.

So you have to use 'git clone' or download files associated with crates.

If I think it's okay for someone else to use this crate, I'll update it to crate.io then.

# Recently Comment
First version is updated.

So, I'll upgrade this codes more pretty, more efficient on the Rust side.
